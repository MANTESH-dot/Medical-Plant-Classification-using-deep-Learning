# Medical Plant Classification using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify different medical plants using a Deep Learning model. The dataset consists of multiple plant species, and the model is trained using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve high classification accuracy.

## Key Features
- Preprocessing of medical plant images.
- Training a CNN-based model for classification.
- Evaluation using standard metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

## Key Metrics & Results
| Metric         | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Training Accuracy      | 90.24%   |
| Testing Accuracy       | 80.84%   |


## Dataset
- The dataset consists of labeled images of different medical plants.
- Images are preprocessed and augmented to improve model generalization.
